# ShoppingCart_JavaApp

The provided Java application represents a scenario where an order processing system is implemented. Here's a description of the application:

The application allows you to process a series of orders by entering the details of each order. It calculates the order total and keeps track of the total price for all orders. Here's how you can interact with the application:

1. When the application starts, it prompts you to enter the number of orders you want to process. You should provide a positive whole number using the keyboard.

2. After entering the number of orders, the application begins processing each order in a loop. It displays a message like "Processing order 1:" and proceeds to collect the necessary information for that order.

3. For each order, the application prompts you to enter the item name. You should provide the name of the item for that order using the keyboard.

4. Next, the application asks you to enter the quantity of the item for that order. You should provide a positive whole number representing the quantity using the keyboard.

5. Then, the application prompts you to enter the price per unit of the item. You should provide a numeric value representing the price per unit using the keyboard.

6. After collecting the item name, quantity, and price per unit, the application calculates the order total by multiplying the quantity and price per unit.

7. The application displays the order total for the current order, in the format "Order Total: $X.XX".

8. The application keeps track of the total price by adding each order's total to the running total.

9. The loop continues for the remaining orders, repeating steps 3-8 until all orders are processed.

10. Once all orders have been processed, the application displays the following information:
    - Total Orders: The number of orders you initially entered.
    - Total Price: The sum of the order totals for all orders, displayed as a monetary value.

11. Finally, the application terminates.

Remember to provide valid input for the number of orders, item name, quantity, and price per unit when prompted by the application.
